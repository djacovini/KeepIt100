##Summary:
KEEP IT 100 will empower consumers to make informed decisions by offering convenient access to a powerful database tracking political spending by corporations. It uses a React front-end, Node back-end, with access to a SQL database of the CPA-Zicklin Index.

KEEP IT 100 exists to link two seemingly disparate aspects of our lives as American citizens.
Modern retail consumerism- We live in a world where massive chains dominate retail sales.	With similar inventories, competitive pricing, and often proximate locations, the decision of whether to purchase hardware at a Home Depot or Lowes, or cold medicine at a CVS or Walgreens, or lightbulbs at a Target or Walmart, often comes down to a whim.  A flip of a coin.  But what if we were equipped with another piece of information?  A reason to cross the street to buy the same product?

Corporate influence in American politics- The controversial 2010 supreme court decision Citizens United pushed campaign finance back under the public spotlight.  Renewed attention was brought to the murky world of political contributions made by corporations.  Most people reject the idea of companies exerting political influence, let alone operating with intentional obfuscation.  Luckily, there exists an organization scoring private sector participants on transparency.  The Center for Political Accountability is a non-partisan, non-profit advocacy organization who- in conjunction with the Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania- is responsible for producing and maintaining the CPA-Zicklin Index.  The CPA-Zicklin Index “benchmarks the political disclosure and accountability policies and practices for election-related spending of leading U.S. public companies.“  100 is the highest score achievable, hence our name.

Inaccessible or inconveniently accessible data is unempowered data.  It reports facts but lacks the utility- the ability to be incorporated into our daily decisions- to drive social change.  As a corollary, for decades the investment community has talked about “corporate citizenship”, but it was the advent of socially conscious “ESG” (environmental, social, and governance) mutual funds that allowed individuals to express their views with their investment dollars.  And while the actual initial impact of these investing habits may be minimal, poor scores do result in an ever-present talking point and pressure change.

KEEP IT 100’s goal is to do for retail consumerism what ESG funds did for retail investing.  Don’t bottle-up your disappointment at the present state of things- express your dismay with your shopping habits!  After all, it is the profit resulting from your purchases that allow these companies to wield political influence politics.
